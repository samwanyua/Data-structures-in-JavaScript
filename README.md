## Introduction

Understanding data structures is fundamental to writing efficient algorithms and building robust software. This repository aims to provide a step-by-step guide for learners to progressively master different data structures using JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-js.git
cd data-structures-js
```
Install dependencies:

bash

``npm install``

## List of Data Structures
#### 1.Arrays

Arrays are one of the most basic data structures in JavaScript. They represent a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, accessible by an index or a key.

#### 2. Linked Lists

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element points to the next one in the sequence. It's particularly useful when you need dynamic memory allocation.

#### 3.Stacks

Stacks are a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. Elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the "top" of the stack. Stacks are widely used in various applications, including function calls, expression evaluation, and undo mechanisms.
#### 4.Queues

 Queues are a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. Queues have applications in scenarios like print spooling, task scheduling, and breadth-first search algorithms.
#### 5.Hash Tables

Hash tables are data structures that implement an associative array abstract data type. They use a hash function to map keys to indices, providing efficient data retrieval. Hash tables are commonly used in applications such as dictionaries and caches.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find an error, want to improve the explanations, or want to add new data structures, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch: ```git checkout -b feature/new-data-structure```.

Make your changes and commit them: ```git commit -m 'Add new data structure```.

## Summary
These data structures form the foundation of understanding more complex algorithms and programming challenges. The template encourages learners to explore each data structure's implementation and usage through provided examples and explanations.
